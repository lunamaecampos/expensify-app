I'm looking to grow and evolve professionally.
I like that ATT offers the opportunity to progress in my career.
I love the diversity at ATT because i can learn and expand.
the value that individuals bring to the table


I have 8+ years of experience with face-to-face interactions with customer.
I love being able to provide the best customer service experience,
have them be content with their purchase all while exceeding company goals and invite
them back to make another purchase with me in the future.

I like to showcase the most popular items and upsell add-ons to complete
thier purchase.



working at lucille's during peak hours was a challenging experience.
sometimes our computer system would break down and we would have to offer guests our
complimentary biscuits with apple butter

sometimes a team member would not be fulfilling their responsibilities and
to solve this issue i would have to figure out why, get them the proper help
so we can successfully continue the workflow of the restaurant

Im always ready to come to work with energy, learn, grow, and exceed company goals!
ATT is the environment that I can thrive in and be my best self!
I am the diversity in talent that ATT is looking for.



What is an example of your best employee or employee that is consistently
exceeding goals?

What opportunities does att offer for a sales consultant that wants to grow?

when will i know a decision?  I would love to get in contact with someone for updates
on my hiring status
